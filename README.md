# dictionary

This is a Python program that allows a user to look up words and their definitions in a dictionary stored in a JSON file.

The program starts by importing the necessary modules, including the JSON module to load the dictionary data from the file and the difflib module to find similar words.

The translate function takes a single argument, the word to look up, and first normalizes it to lowercase. The function then checks if the word is in the dictionary as is, or in titlecase or uppercase form. If the word is found, the function returns its definition.

If the word is not found, the get_close_matches function is used to find up to 3 similar words in the dictionary. If any similar words are found, the user is prompted to confirm if they meant the suggested word instead. If the user confirms, the function returns the definition of the suggested word. If the user denies or enters an invalid input, the function returns an appropriate message. If no similar words are found, the function returns a message indicating that the word doesn't exist.

The program prompts the user to enter a word to look up and calls the translate function to get the word's definition or a suggestion for a similar word. If the output is a list, the program iterates over the list and prints each item. Otherwise, it prints the output as is.
